sabre/vobject
=============

The VObject library allows you to easily parse and manipulate [iCalendar](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)
and [vCard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350) objects using PHP.

The goal of the VObject library is to create a very complete library, with an easy-to-use API.


Installation
------------

Make sure you have [Composer][1] installed, and then run:

    composer require sabre/vobject "^4.0"

This package requires PHP 5.5. If you need the PHP 5.3/5.4 version of this package instead, use:


    composer require sabre/vobject "^3.4"
